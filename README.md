# CPX65 - A 65xx cross assembler

This is supposed to become an assembler with features I'd like to see in a
65xx cross assembler, such as minimizing zero page use via 'annotations',
accessing 'structs' via indirect addressing, marking blocks of code read-only
(avoiding self-modifying code being moving into ROM).

Also a proper preproccesor and linker.

We'll see how it goes =)
